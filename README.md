In this project, I have analyzed customer behavior in the Starbucks mobile app. The customers receive promotional offers every few days. The task is to identify which customers are influenced by promotional offers. From a business perspective, it doesn’t make sense to send all offers to all customers and this analysis will help us find target audience in order to optimize marketing ROI.
